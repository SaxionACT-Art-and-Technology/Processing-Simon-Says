## Program Simon Says with Processing ##

Step by step tutorial that explains how to program Simon Says in Processing.
We will create a button class, a tone generator and the logic behind the game. 

This tutorial is suited for beginning/intermediate programmers. We assume you have basic programming knowledge in Processing. 

Check out the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnfaWhAwvwdrydaRuG8J8v8LQmrzIyXd) with the 6 videos. The whole series will take you about 135 minutes to watch.
